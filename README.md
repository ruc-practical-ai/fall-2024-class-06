# Fall 2024 Class 06 - Know Your Sensor

This class reviews some basic principles in machine learning.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation and Use via Github Codespaces (Recommended)

To use this repository via codespaces simply click on the `code` &rarr; `codespaces` &rarr; `create codespace on main` buttons.

Once the codespace is open in the browser, click the three bars in the top left corner and select `Open in VS Code Desktop`.

If required, use `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Codespaces: Rebuild Container` to rebuild the container. Do not use `gh codespace rebuild`. This takes a long time since it re-downloads the entire image.

### Display of Presentations via Github Codespaces (Recommended)

Navigate to the `presentations` folder.

```bash
cd presentations
```

Start an http-server.

```bash
bash ../scripts/start_server.sh
```
### Use via Dev Container

To use this repository via a Dev Container, be sure you have the Dev Containers extension installed, along with Docker Desktop and WSL 2 (Windows only). Clone the repository, open VS Code in the repository root, and click the button shown in the pop up in the bottom-right corner to open in the Dev Container.

If the popup doesn't show type `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Reopen in Container` (if the container is already built) or `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Build and Open in Container` if the container is not yet built.

### Local Installation

The dependencies required for local installation can be found in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and `.devcontainer/configure_environment.sh`.

For local installation, perform set up and install dependencies in the order they appear in the Dockerfile and the configuration script, starting with the Dockerfile.

Final setup commands can be found in `.devcontainer/post_attach.sh`.

Note that setup will be different depending on the local OS.

#### Viewing HTML Pages Directly in a Browser from Local Installation

To view HTML pages directly in a browser, simply navigate to the pages of interest and open them with a preferred web browser.

#### Selecting the Correct Python Interpreter

If the correct Python interpreter is not selected by default, select it manually in VS Code.

Open the command pallette with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and type `Python: Select Interpreter`.

Now specify that VSCode should use the that interpreter (the one in `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe`). Once you specify this, Jupyter notebooks should show the project's interpreter as an option when you click the `kernel` icon or the small icon showing the current version of python (e.g., `Python 3.12.1`) and then click `Select Another Kernel`, and finally click `Python Environments...`.
